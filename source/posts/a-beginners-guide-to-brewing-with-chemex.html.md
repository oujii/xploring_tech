We then fed our dreams to "Text Synth" a ML model trained on text. <https://bellard.org/textsynth/>  

Here's an example of what it gave us

> "He said: you say: we do not come together all the time I am the one who comes you're the one who is not able to come I say: but do not worry this is no disaster the disaster is inside you where your heart lives where it is not your hands which betray me your tongue my heart is your throat I say: love I say it's the beginning the end everything is the beginning and everything is the end the truth you tell me you are not your hands and your tongue and the light in you my words will reach you in your heart in your sleep in your dreams in your waking in your death in the dark in the bright in your fear in your dreams in the light in your sleep I say your tongue I say your hands I say your heart I say your love I say your dreams I say your life I say your death and your birth"

And the outcome, here's Lisas generated image:
